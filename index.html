Hello nilson carroll, my name is Jorge Acuna and Biology is my major,<br>
my interests are being with my friends and science.<br>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I play a couple games, mostly games that give me difficulty like UFC, Mortal combat and Rain World.<br>
What I find important is my school work and my grades because its important. !)<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">I'm taking this course because I need it for a requirement and overall it seems fun. <br>
<p style="color:Green;">I am not sure what queer games are, but I'm guessing I will find out.
